Udaconnect application is transformed from a monolith to microservice architecture.
I have used the following to model the microservice architecture.

1. Kafka
2. gRPC
3. RESTful API endpoint

There was no need to divide the frontend on microservices.

In the backend, I felt the need to separate it into person, location microservice and location producer.

Person API was created without any changes.
RESTful API was used for easy integration with various HTTP routes for the data of the person.
Connection microservice uses RESTful API because of its simplicity and maintainability.

To handle large amount of data and streaming it, Kafka and gRPC was used for performance in the location producer.
